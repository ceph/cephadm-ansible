Introduction
------------

cephadm-ansible is a collection of Ansible modules and playbooks to simplify
workflows that are not covered by [cephadm]_. They are covered by the following playbooks:

* cephadm-preflight.yml: Initial setup of hosts before bootstrapping the cluster
* cephadm-clients.yml: Setting up client hosts
* cephadm-purge-cluster.yml: Remove a Ceph cluster
* cephadm-distribute-ssh-key.yml: Distribute a SSH public key to all hosts
* cephadm-set-container-insecure-registries.yml: Add a block in /etc/containers/registries.conf to add an insecure registry

Additionnally, several ansible modules are provided in order to let people writing their own playbooks.

Terminology
-----------

**admin host**
  A host where the admin keyring and ceph config file are present. Although the admin host and the bootstrap host are usually the same host, it is possible to have multiple admin hosts later.
  ``cephadm`` will make a host become 'admin' when the label ``_admin`` is added to that host. (ie: ``ceph orch host label add <host> _admin``).
  This hosts should be present in the group ``[admin]`` in the ansible inventory.
  If for some reason you decide a host shouldn't be a 'admin host' anymore, you have to :

  * remove it from the group ``[admin]`` in the ansible inventory,
  * remove the admin keyring,
  * remove the ceph config file,
  * remove the ``_admin`` label. (ie ``ceph orch host label rm <host> _admin``)


**ansible host**
  The host where any cephadm-ansible playbook is run.

**bootstrap host**
  The host where the ceph cluster will start. Unless you pass the ``--skip-admin-label`` option to the ``ceph bootstram`` command, this host will receive the admin keyring and the ceph config file and should be considered as an 'admin host'.
  This host should be present in the group ``[admin]`` in the ansible inventory.


Ansible inventory
-----------------
The ansible inventory is a file where all the hosts intended to be part of the ceph cluster will be listed.
The most common format are INI or YAML.

Although you probably want to keep it as simple as possible, you can organize your inventory and create groups, `cephadm-ansible` won't differentiate except for the following requirements:

* Client hosts must be defined in a dedicated group ``[clients]``.
* Both ``cephadm-purge-cluster.yml`` and ``cephadm-clients.yml`` playbooks require a group ``[admin]`` with at least one admin host (usually it will be the bootstrap node).

.. note:: the name of the client group can be changed. In that case you have to set the variable `client_group`.

Otherwise, you can create groups such as ``[monitors]``, ``[osds]``, ``[rgws]``, that might help you keep clarity in your inventory file and ease the ``--limit`` usage if you plan to use it to target specific a group of hosts only.

A basic inventory would look like following::

   # cat hosts
   ceph-mon1
   ceph-mon2
   ceph-mon3
   ceph-osd1
   ceph-osd2
   ceph-osd3
   ceph-mds1
   ceph-mds2
   ceph-rgw1
   ceph-rgw2

   [clients]
   ceph-client1
   ceph-client2
   ceph-client3

   [admin]
   ceph-mon1


Playbooks
---------

cephadm-preflight
=================

This playbook configures the Ceph repository.
It also installs some prerequisites (podman, lvm2, chronyd, cephadm, ...)

Usage::

   ansible-playbook -i <inventory host file> cephadm-preflight.yml


You can limit the execution to a set of hosts by using ``--limit`` option::

   ansible-playbook -i <inventory host file> cephadm-preflight.yml --limit <my_osd_group|my_node_name>


You can override variables using ``--extra-vars`` parameter::


   ansible-playbook -i <inventory host file> cephadm-preflight.yml --extra-vars "ceph_origin=rhcs"



Options
+++++++

ceph_origin
~~~~~~~~~~~
**description**
  The source of Ceph repositories.


**valid values**

``rhcs``
  Repository from Red Hat Ceph Storage.
``community``
  Community repository (https://download.ceph.com)
``custom``
  Custom repository.
  When ``ceph_origin: custom`` is defined, you have to set the variable ``custom_repo_url`` with the URL of your repository.
  Passing the extra-var ``-e custom_repo_state=absent`` allows you to remove this repository later.

  It also supports deploying multiple repositories, in that case you must set the variable ``ceph_custom_repositories`` instead.
  ``ceph_custom_repositories`` is a dictionnary that should look like following::

    ceph_custom_repositories:
      - name: ceph_custom_noarch
        state: present
        description: Ceph custom repo noarch
        gpgcheck: 'no'
        baseurl: https://4.chacra.ceph.com/r/ceph/main/cf17ed16c3964b635e9b6c22e607ea5672341c5c/centos/8/flavors/default/noarch
        file: ceph_shaman_build_noarch
        priority: '2'
        enabled: 1
      - name: ceph_custom_x86_64
        state: present
        description: Ceph custom repo x86_64
        gpgcheck: 'no'
        baseurl: https://4.chacra.ceph.com/r/ceph/main/cf17ed16c3964b635e9b6c22e607ea5672341c5c/centos/8/flavors/default/x86_64
        file: ceph_shaman_build_x86_64
        priority: '2'
        enabled: 1

  Given that the definition is more complex, you might want to define it as a group_vars/host_vars rather than as an extra-var::

    $ cat group_vars/all
    ---
    ceph_custom_repositories:
      - name: ceph_custom_noarch
        state: present

        file: ceph_shaman_build_noarch

Modules
-------

Introduction
============

cephadm-ansible provides several modules to make it easier to write playbooks around cephadm/ceph orch.
The idea is to let you write your own playbooks, rather than providing a unique playbook that would try to cover anyone's use case.
This way you can have a solution that fits better with your needs.

At the moment only the most important tasks are supported.
This means that any operation not covered would have to be done either with either the ``command`` or ``shell`` Ansible tasks in your playbook.

Samples
=======

This shows how the supported modules can be used in a playbook.
This doesn't cover the pre-requisites steps (preflight, ...) so it implies all requirements are satisfied (podman, lvm2,...).
It assumes your "bootstrap host" (or "admin host") can ssh to other hosts with root user without password.

Bootstrap and add some hosts::

   # cat hosts
   ceph-mon1 monitor_address=10.10.10.101 labels="['_admin', 'mon', 'mgr']"
   ceph-mon2 labels="['mon', 'mgr']"
   ceph-mon3 labels="['mon', 'mgr']"
   ceph-osd1 labels="['osd']"
   ceph-osd2 labels="['osd']"
   ceph-osd3 labels="['osd']"
   # cat site.yml
   ---
   - name: bootstrap the cluster
     hosts: ceph-mon1
     become: true
     gather_facts: false
     tasks:
       - name: login to quay.io registry
         cephadm_registry_login:
           state: login
           registry_url: quay.io
           registry_username: foo
           registry_password: b4r

       - name: bootstrap initial cluster
         cephadm_bootstrap:
           mon_ip: "{{ monitor_address }}"

   - name: add more hosts
     hosts: all
     become: true
     gather_facts: true
     tasks:
       - name: add hosts to the cluster
         ceph_orch_host:
           name: "{{ ansible_facts['hostname'] }}"
           address: "{{ ansible_facts['default_ipv4']['address'] }}"
           labels: "{{ labels }}"
         delegate_to: ceph-mon1

   - name: deploy osd service
     hosts: ceph-mon1
     become: true
     gather_facts: false
     tasks:
       - name: apply osd spec
         ceph_orch_apply:
         spec: |
           service_type: osd
           service_id: osd
           placement:
             host_pattern: '*'
             label: osd
           spec:
             data_devices:
               all: true

   - name: change osd_default_notify_timeout option
     hosts: ceph-mon1
     become: true
     gather_facts: false
     tasks:
       - name: decrease the value of osd_default_notify_timeout option
         ceph_config:
           action: set
           who: osd
           option: osd_default_notify_timeout
           value: 20


.. note:: You may have noticed that most of the time, the target node in the different plays in the playbook above is ``ceph-mon1``, which is the bootstrap node.
